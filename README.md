reverse-engineered xal token generator for epic games talon sdk.

xal is the browser fingerprint token sent during epic login. it collects 15 fingerprint fields, shuffles them with mt19937, hashes with fnv-1a, compresses with zlib, encrypts with chacha20, and base64 encodes the result.

## token format

```
base64(nonce[12] + random[4 LE] + chacha20_ciphertext)
```

after decryption and decompression, each entry is `{ fnv1a_hash[4] + json_len[4] + json_bytes }` followed by a checksum.

the shuffle order is seeded by a random u32. the chacha20 nonce is `base_nonce ^ random` per-word. checksum is a running fnv1a XOR'd with random.

## setup

```
npm install @babel/parser @babel/traverse @babel/generator @babel/types
```

## usage

### 1. extract key from fresh xal.js

grab `xal.js` from talon sdk and drop it in the project root:

```
node extractor/deob.js
```

this deobfuscates the script, extracts the chacha20 key + nonce by pattern-matching the AST for `new Uint8Array([...32])` and `new Uint32Array([...3])`, evals them in a sandbox, and writes `config.json`.

### 2. generate tokens

```
node gen.js
```

outputs `{"xal":"...","ewa":"b","kid":"Yjqmlr"}` ready to use.

static fields (gpu, properties, stack trace, resources) are from a real chrome fingerprint. dynamic fields (timestamps, session id, visitor id, mouse/keyboard events, screen, canvas hash, hardware) are randomized per call.

### 3. debug

decode a token:
```
node debug/decoder.js <base64_xal_token>
```

encode from json:
```
node debug/encoder.js [config.json] [xal_data.json]
```

## files

| file | what it does |
|---|---|
| `config.json` | chacha20 key + nonce, auto-generated by extractor |
| `gen.js` | generates realistic xal tokens with randomized dynamic fields |
| `extractor/deob.js` | deobfuscates xal.js, extracts encryption key via AST pattern matching + vm eval |
| `debug/decoder.js` | decodes xal token back to fingerprint json |
| `debug/encoder.js` | encodes fingerprint json into xal token |

## notes

- key rotates daily, re-run the extractor with a fresh xal.js each time
- extractor matches by structure not variable names, survives obfuscator renames
- no hardcoded keys, everything derived from the source
